Chair-ific is a unique job-matching app designed to remove bias by focusing solely on skills, culture, and values—keeping identities hidden until the right match is made. Here’s how it works:

Anonymous, Bias-Free Profiles: Both employers and employees create anonymous profiles. Employers outline their company culture, benefits, and post job positions, each specifying three required skills. Employees list their top five skills and hobbies, helping show who they are beyond the resume. By keeping identities hidden, Chair-ific removes prejudice, allowing true connections based on what matters.

Culture-Driven, Skill-Based Matching: Chair-ific combines skills and cultural alignment for an ideal match. Both parties answer at least ten targeted questions, and our algorithm aligns these responses with skills to ensure matches aren’t just job fits—they’re cultural fits too.

Reveal and Connect: When a match is made, users can choose to reveal identities to take the next step toward an interview. This process gives both sides confidence that they’re meeting someone aligned in values and skills.

A Chair-Themed Experience: True to its name, Chair-ific plays on the theme of chairs and “finding your perfect seat.” With engaging phrases like “Your throne setup,” Chair-ific makes job hunting feel like finding a place where you truly belong.

Why Chair-ific? Chair-ific solves two major issues in hiring: bias and superficial matching. By hiding identities and focusing on core skills and values, Chair-ific fosters genuine, lasting connections and creates an inclusive hiring process that prioritizes fit over facades.
